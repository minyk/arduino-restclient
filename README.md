RestClient for Arduino with WiFiEsp library
============================================

HTTP Request library for Arduino and the ESP8266(wiht WiFiEsp library).

# Install

Clone (or download and unzip) the repository to `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`
where `~/Documents/Arduino` is your sketchbook directory.

    > cd ~/Documents/Arduino
    > mkdir libraries
    > cd libraries
    > git clone https://github.com/minyk/arduino-restclient.git RestClient

# Usage

### Include

You need to have the `WiFiEsp` library already included.

```c++
#include <WiFiEsp.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include "RestClient.h"
```

### RestClient(host/ip, [port])

Constructor to create an RestClient object to make requests against.

Use domain name and default to port 80:
```c++
RestClient client = RestClient("arduino-http-lib-test.herokuapp.com");
```

Use a local IP and an explicit port:
```c++
RestClient client = RestClient("192.168.1.50",5000);
```

## RESTful methods

All methods return an HTTP status code or 0 if there was an error.

### `get(const char* path)`
### `get(const char* path, String* response)`

Start making requests!

```c++
int statusCode = client.get("/"));
```

Pass in a string *by reference* for the response:
```
String response = "";
int statusCode = client.get("/", &response);
```

### post(const char* path, const char* body)
### post(const char* path, String* response)
### post(const char* path, const char* body, String* response)

```
String response = "";
int statusCode = client.post("/", &response);
statusCode = client.post("/", "foo=bar");
response = "";
statusCode = client.post("/", "foo=bar", &response);
```

### put(const char* path, const char* body)
### put(const char* path, String* response)
### put(const char* path, const char* body, String* response)

```
String response = "";
int statusCode = client.put("/", &response);
statusCode = client.put("/", "foo=bar");
response = "";
statusCode = client.put("/", "foo=bar", &response);
```

### del(const char* path)
### del(const char* path, const char* body)
### del(const char* path, String* response)
### del(const char* path, const char* body, String* response)

```
String response = "";
int statusCode = client.del("/", &response);
```

## Debug Mode

If you're having trouble, you can always open `RestClient.cpp` and throw at the top:

```c++
#define HTTP_DEBUG
```

Everything happening in the client will get printed to the Serial port.
